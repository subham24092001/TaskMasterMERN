# Taskmaster Website

Taskmaster is a simple TODO list web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks after logging in. Users can sign up, log in, and log out to manage their tasks efficiently.

## Features

- User authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out functionality.
- Secure user data storage: User IDs are stored in the local storage for persistent login sessions.
- CRUD operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Responsive design: Tailwind CSS is utilized for a clean and mobile-friendly user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing task data.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
